EB Garamond — Claude Garamont’s designs go opensource.

This project aims at providing a free version of the Garamond types, based on the Designs of the Berner specimen from 1592.

This is a work in progress, so expect bugs! You can see every font’s current state in its *-Glyphs.pdf file in the specimen section.
